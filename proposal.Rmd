## Objectives:
Identify characteristics of patients who are both medically high-risk and financially costly.

Examine patterns and drivers of healthcare expenditures across different conditions and populations.

## Background:
In 2023, healthcare spending in the United States accounted for 17.6% of the national GDP, totaling approximately $4.9 trillion. Despite this immense expenditure, millions of Americans continue to struggle with chronic diseases, and healthcare delivery remains highly fragmented. This inefficiency not only strains the system financially but also results in poorer outcomes for those who need care the most.
One of the central challenges is the “hot spotters” problem—a small subset of patients who incur the highest costs often receive the least coordinated and least effective care. Understanding who these patients are, what conditions they have, and how their costs evolve over time is critical for developing targeted interventions that improve health outcomes while reducing unnecessary spending.

## Study Purpose:
This project aims to analyze the relationship between healthcare costs and medical conditions to uncover patterns among high-cost patients. By identifying key demographic and clinical characteristics associated with elevated healthcare spending, we can inform strategies for better resource allocation and more integrated models of care.


## Methods:
To achieve these goals, we conducted statistical analyses using patient-level cost and diagnosis data. We applied techniques such as regression modeling and clustering to detect trends and associations between chronic conditions and total healthcare expenditures. Additionally, we developed interactive visualizations and a web-based dashboard in R to make the results accessible for policy analysts, healthcare administrators, and researchers.


## Expected Impact:
Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of cost drivers within the healthcare system and support efforts to design value-based care models that prioritize prevention, care coordination, and patient-centered outcomes.
