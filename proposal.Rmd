## Objectives:
Identify characteristics of patients who are both medically high-risk and financially costly.

Examine patterns and drivers of healthcare expenditures across different conditions and populations.

Dataset can be found at [H251](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data/pufs/h251/h251doc.shtml) and [H249](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data_files_detail.jsp?cboPufNumber=HC-249).

## Background:
In 2023, healthcare spending in the United States accounted for 17.6% of the national GDP, totaling approximately \$4.9 trillion. Despite this substantial level of expenditure, millions of Americans continue to live with chronic diseases, and healthcare delivery remains highly fragmented. This mismatch between spending and outcomes not only places considerable financial strain on the system, but also leads to suboptimal health outcomes for those who require care the most.

A central concern within this context is the “hot spotters” phenomenon, in which a relatively small subset of patients accounts for a disproportionately large share of total expenditures, yet often receives care that is poorly coordinated and insufficiently effective. Understanding who these patients are, which conditions they experience, and how their costs evolve over time is critical for designing targeted interventions that both improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary spending.

<br>

## Study Purpose:
This project aims to examine the relationship between healthcare costs and medical conditions in order to uncover patterns among high-cost patients. By identifying key demographic and clinical characteristics associated with elevated healthcare spending, we seek to inform strategies that support more efficient resource allocation and promote more integrated models of care.

<br>

## Methods:
To achieve these goals,  we conduct statistical analyses using patient-level cost and diagnosis data from the consolidated file (`H251`) and the conditions file (`H249`). All analyses are implemented in `R` using packages such as `tidyverse`, `survey`, and `MEPS`. We apply methods such as regression modeling and clustering to detect trends and associations between chronic conditions and total healthcare expenditures. In addition, we develop interactive visualizations and a web-based dashboard in R to make the results accessible and interpretable for policy analysts, healthcare administrators, and researchers.

<br>

## Expected Impact:
Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the drivers of healthcare costs within the U.S. system and support efforts to design value-based care models that emphasize prevention, care coordination, and patient-centered outcomes. By focusing on patients who are both medically complex and financially costly, this work has the potential to inform interventions that simultaneously improve quality of care and contain expenditures.
